# Semicircle Pattern Using Python Turtle Graphics

The circle has the shape of a ring. With the help of a turtle in Python, we can draw a circle. The turtle is acting as a pen, drawing a circle in its exact shape. In this activity, however, I used a half circle instead. A semicircle is another name for a half-circle. It's made by cutting the circle in half along its diameter. Orange is a vital color that represents warmth and a lively mood. These colors were chosen because they are always able to draw attention. Orange is the most vibrant color, while black is the darkest. Almost any color, especially brighter, more vibrant colors like orange, looks great with black. Orange is associated with fire, beautiful sunsets, flowers, and Halloween when combined with black. The design can be made more vibrant and uplifting by using a brighter color.
